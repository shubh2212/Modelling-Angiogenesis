Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. In this report we present a discrete mathematical model which describes the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. We then use an implicit, unconditionally stable high order compact (HOC) finite difference scheme, using parameter values based on experimental data, to solve and simulate the endothelial cell behaviour during Angiogenesis.
